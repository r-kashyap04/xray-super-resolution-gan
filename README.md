# Medical X-Ray GAN Enhancement & Dashboard Analysis

## 🧠 Project Objective
To enhance medical X-ray images using a GAN model and evaluate performance using PSNR & SSIM.

## 🧪 Dataset
- Chest X-ray Images: NORMAL vs PNEUMONIA
- Source: [Kaggle / Your Dataset Link]

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python (for GAN training)
- OpenCV, skimage (for PSNR/SSIM)
- Power BI (for visual analytics)

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
- PSNR/SSIM summary for NORMAL & PNEUMONIA images
- Category-wise performance analysis
- KPI cards and scatter plot

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `psnr_ssim_analysis.py` to get image quality scores
4. Open Power BI Dashboard with `Medical_Dashboard.pbix`
